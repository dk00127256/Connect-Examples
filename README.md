# Amazon Connect Automated Outbound Calling System

This repository contains a solution designed to automate calling processes for small businesses using Amazon Connect, specifically leveraging the StartOutboundVoiceContact API to initiate calls based on Lambda triggers. This system is particularly beneficial for businesses looking to automatically inform customers about upcoming appointments or reservations.

## Overview
Amazon Connect is a scalable, cloud-based contact center service that makes it easy for any business to deliver better customer service at lower cost. This service provides a seamless experience across voice and chat for your customers and agents. This includes functionalities like automated outbound calling systems which are essential for reminders, notifications, and other customer engagement strategies.

## Components
Amazon Connect: Hosts the contact center, manages contact flows, and handles outbound calling capabilities.
Outbound Dialer: Utilizes Amazon Connect's StartOutboundVoiceContact API to place calls to customers automatically.
AWS Lambda: Triggers the Amazon Connect outbound dialer based on predefined events, such as upcoming appointments.

## How It Works
The system integrates Amazon Connect with AWS Lambda. When an event is triggered (e.g., an upcoming appointment), a Lambda function is invoked which then calls the StartOutboundVoiceContact API to initiate a phone call to the customer. This contact flow can be customized to deliver personalized messages about the appointment details.

## Setup
### Amazon Connect Instance Setup
Create and configure an Amazon Connect instance if you do not already have one.
Define a contact flow that includes prompts or messages you wish to play during the call.

### AWS Lambda Configuration
Create a Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
Ensure that the Lambda has the necessary permissions to invoke Amazon Connect APIs.

### Integration
In the Lambda function, utilize the StartOutboundVoiceContact API to initiate calls. The phone number and message details will be passed as parameters.

## API Reference
StartOutboundVoiceContact: This API is used to start outbound calls from Amazon Connect. It requires parameters such as DestinationPhoneNumber, ContactFlowId, and InstanceId.
python

import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    client = boto3.client('connect')
    response = client.start_outbound_voice_contact(
        DestinationPhoneNumber='+1234567890',
        ContactFlowId='abcdef11-2222-3333-4444-555555555555',
        InstanceId='instance123'
    )
    return response
